abstract: Particle tracking applied to video passive microrheology is conventionally done through methods that are far from being automatic. Creating mechanisms that decode the image set properties and correctly detect the tracer beads, to find their trajectories, is fundamental to facilitate microrheology studies. In this work, the adequacy of two particle detection methods - a Radial Symmetry-based approach and Gaussian fitting - for microrheology setups is tested, both on a synthetic database and on real data. Results show that it is possible to automate the particle tracking process in this scope, while ensuring high detection accuracy and sub-pixel precision, crucial for an adequate characterization of microrheology studies.
